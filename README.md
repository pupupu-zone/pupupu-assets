### Uha Assets

### What is it?
An asset archive, obv

### What does it contain?
Currently, it is just a collection of logotypes from providers used by me or my friends.

### For what?
Potentially it is a master-record for mirroring related data (logotypes, metadata) into local run, so no need to update image or migrate db manually when a new logo is added.

For now, itâ€™s something like a storage

### Future
I'll add more metadata and integrate it with the app. Probably.
